Video requirments
------------------------------------------------
Gish requires a video card with full OpenGL support.  99% of all problems experienced with Gish are because of video drivers.  Make sure you have the latest updates for your computer installed.  If Gish is not working correctly, running very slowly, exiting or crashing at new screens, or the mouse is very jerky your video card may not have OpenGL drivers installed.  

If you still have problems please check out the Gish forum:

System Requirements
------------------------------------------------
Minimum system requirements:
  Windows 98/ME/2000/XP, Linux or OSX 10.1+
  AMD,Intel or G3 1000+ Mhz processor
  OpenGL video card with 32 mb of memory
  256MB of memory

Recommended system requirements:
  AMD, Intel, or G4 1500+ Mhz processor
  OpenGL VideoCard with 64+ mb of memory
  256MB of memory

Controls:

In the Options you can change the controls, or set up a joystick.  A game pad works very will and we recommend using one if you have it.


Use the Arrow keys to move
A             Stick
S             Slick
D             Heavy
Space Bar     Jump
P             Pauses

A game pad is very useful for playing Gish and if you have one, we recommend using it.

Stick can be used to climb up walls, pick up objects, or creatures, and move along the ceiling.

Slick is useful for fitting through small areas, and squeezing out of tight spots. 

Heavy will make you fall faster, and help crush bad guys and break things.  It also helps you dive while under water.

Jump is tricky to learn, the more compressed Gish is the higher he will jump.  By using the arrow keys in combination with jump you can "bounce" Gish higher and higher.  By holding down when you are falling, waiting tell Gish is as flat as possible, then pressing jump and holding up tell he reaches the highest point of his jump and then pressing down and repeating you should be able to get Gish to jump very high.  Practice makes perfect.

Modes:
Gish can be played in 3 different modes:

Start from the main menu will get you to new game, or collection mode.  New game will start a single player game.  Collection mode will let you select a collection level to play.
